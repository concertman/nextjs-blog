So I've been wanting to set up my own website for a while now. I want to put a number of things on there. Stuff I've learned. Stuff I'm not sure about. And just general ramblings.

So will this work? Probably.

Let's give it a go

```swift
func newFunction() -> String {
    "this text"
}
```

I'll have to come up with a design I like though.
